crucible-run - run tests

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*crucible run* [--fork|--no-fork] [--no-cleanup] [--dump|--no-dump]
               [--jobs=<jobs> | -j <jobs>] [--[no-]separate-cleanup-threads]
               [--isolation=<method> | -I <method>]
               [--junit-xml=<junit-xml-file>]
               [--device-id=<device-id>]
               [--all-queues]
               [--verbose]
               [<pattern>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run all tests that match <pattern>.  If no <pattern> is
given, then run all functional tests and stress tests (those whose name matches
"func.\*" or "stress.*").

PATTERN RULES
-------------
Crucible matches each test name against the given glob <pattern>s with
*fnmatch(3)*. The patterns are tested in order from left to right, and the last
matching pattern wins.  If no test pattern is given, then the implied pattern
"*" is used.

Test patterns that begin with \'!' denotes an exclude rule; otherwise the
pattern denotes an include rule. If the first given pattern is an exclude
pattern, then Crucible inserts an implied "*" as the first pattern.

Test patterns can optionally add a suffix specifying the queue family index to
use when running the test.  For example func.foo.q0 will only run the func.foo
test on queue family index 0, and func.foo.q1 will only run the func.foo
test on queue family index 1.  If the suffix is not used, then the test will
be run on all detected queue families.

Special tests match only patterns with special prefixes.  Example tests match
only patterns that start with "example.".  Benchmark tests match only patterns
that start with "bench.".  Crucible's self tests match only patterns that start
with "self.".  As a corollary, special tests do not match the pattern "*".

OPTIONS
-------
--fork, --no-fork [default: enabled]::
    Run tests outside or inside the test runner's dispatcher process. With forking
    enabled, the test runner's dispatcher process is protected from test crashes.
    However, forking also makes debugging tests more difficult.

--no-cleanup::
    Disable each test's cleanup phase. This is useful because a test may crash
    during cleanup but otherwise pass.

--dump, --no-dump [default: disabled]::
    Dump (or disable dumping) test images into Crucible's data directory.

-j <jobs>, --jobs=<jobs>::
    Number of tests to run simultaneously. Similar to GNU Make's -j option.

-I <method>, --isolation=<method> [default: method=process]::
    Select the method the runner uses to isolate tests. The runner will start
    each test in a separate process if <method> is "p" or "process", and in
    a separate thread if <method> is "t" or "thread".

--[no-]separate-cleanup-threads [default: enabled]::
    If enabled, then the test's "result" thread [1] will create a new thread
    in which to run the test's cleanup handlers. If disabled, then the cleanup
    handlers will run directly in the "result" thread.
    +
    This option is useful for detecting and investigating driver bugs that
    occur when objects are created in one thread and destroyed in another.
    +
    [fn1] The test's "result" thread is the one that chooses the test result,
    thus ending the test, usually by calling functions t_pass(), t_fail(), or
    t_assert().

--junit-xml=<junit-xml-file>::
    Write JUnit XML to the given file.

--device-id=<device-id>::
    Select the Vulkan device ID (IDs start from 1).

--all-queues::
    Run tests on all queues for all queue families. By default, only the
    first queue from a queue family will be tested.

--verbose::
    Show more detailed output when executing tests. When
    VK_KHR_debug_report is available, show all the available messages
    instead of just warnings and errors.
